								SETTING UP GIT
###############################################################################

	-- To start we need to install Git in order to upload to GitHub
	
[How to Install]

-- On a windows machine you can install Git by opening a new cmd terminal
	~~ For readabilty I will include which type of code terminal to use in brackets []. 	e.g. - [cmd] mkdir newFolder  !! DO NOT INCLUDE [cmd] IN CODE !! ~~
	- Once terminal window is opened enter the following command:
	- [cmd] winget install Git.Git
	(this will install Git and all it's neccesary files to operate without the need of navigating to the webpage and installing the installer)


-- On a Mac OS machine (null)

-- On a Linux machine (null)



[Setting up GitHub]

-- If you do not have a GitHub account, then after creating your new account and are finished setting up your profile, 
	navigate to my repositories and click "NEW".
	- Give your new repository a memorable name
	- Select privacy (Public or Private)
	(Public = Anyone on the internet can see this repository. You choose who can commit.)
	(Private = You choose who can see and commit to this repository.)
	- Decide whether to have GitHub include a README file (which basically includes just the repository title),
	or upload your own (more on README: whats_README.txt)
	- Decide whther to add .gitignore file (more on .gitignore: whats_gitignore.txt)
	- Choose which license to include (more on licensing: choose_license.txt)
	
	- Once finished setting up repository, click "Create Repository"
	(CONGRATS: You have just made your first GitHub repo! Although, it's a little empty, so let's go ahead and add some files.)
