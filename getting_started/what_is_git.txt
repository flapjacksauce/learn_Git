				WHAT IS GIT
###############################################################################

	-- Git tracks the changes you make in a file or folders essentially
	
[How It Works]

-- Once you create a repository, in the background Git creates whats know as a .get file
	~~ Importance of .get folder  !! DO NOT TAMPER WITH CODE !! ~~
	- A .get file is responsible for all the changes and updates to a GitHub repository
	- Where ever the .get file is located in your projects file, 
	that is the ROOT of the repository, meaning any other folder or file after the .get is included into the repo.
	- If the .get file is moved or tampered with in any way it can have negative effects on Git to track the progrss or perhaps not at all. (.get is vital to the repo)


-- [Responsibilities]

	- It stores what's known as headers that hold the sole duty to store information so that it's reusable across multiple files 
		- including variables
		- functions
		- structures
		- macros
		
	- contains all information that is necessary for the project and all information relating commits 
		- remote repository address
		- Contains a log that stores commit history 
		- Roll back to the desired version of the code
	
	(TO better understand this let's make a new project so we can see the .git in action)
