# WHAT IS GIT  

> Git tracks the changes you make in a file or folders essentially
	
# How It Works  

1. Creates a repository

    > Once you create a repository, in the background Git creates whats know as a .git file  
    > A .git file is responsible for all the changes and updates to a GitHub repository  
    > Where ever the .git file is located in your projects file, that is the ROOT of the repository.  
    > Meaning, any other folder or file after the .git is included into the repo.  
    > If the .git file is moved or tampered with in any way it can have negative effects on Git to track the progress or perhaps not at all.  
    > (.git is vital to the repo)  
    * Importance of .git folder  !! DO NOT TAMPER WITH !! ~~  

# Responsibilities

2. What .git does
    > It stores what's known as headers that hold the sole duty to store information so that it's reusable across multiple files 
    * including variables
    * functions
    * structures
    * macros  
	

    > Contains all information that is necessary for the project and all information relating commits 
	* Remote repository address
	* Contains a log that stores commit history 
	* Roll back to the desired version of the code
	
    > (TO better understand this, let's make a new startup project so we can see the .git in action)
